# Action-Category-RL
Using object-action information with RL - the high-level idea is to improve learning performance of RL algorithms by incorporating domain knowledge in the form of object-action relationships (affordances) using human demonstrations.

Code for the work implemented in: **Action Categorization for Computationally Improved Task Learning and Planning**, *Lakshmi Nair and Sonia Chernova*, AAMAS 2018

RL implementation mostly based on [https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python). Additionally, the following were implemented:
- RL policy evaluation
- Epsilon Greedy update
- Lightworld domain 
- Action-Category Representation
